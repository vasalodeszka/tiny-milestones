# Conventional Commits Cheatsheet (https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
#
# <type> indicates what kind of commit this is.
# It can be one of:
#   - feat        for a new feature
#   - fix         for a bug fix
#   - docs        for documentation only changes
#   - style       for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#   - refactor    for code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   - perf        for code change that improves performance
#   - test        for adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#   - build       for changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
#   - ci          for changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
#   - chore       for other changes that don't modify src or test files
#   - revert      for reverting commits made previously
#
# <scope> describes a section of the codebase where this change is applied and is optional.
# Note that allowed content of this section depends on the specific project.
# Issue identifiers are not valid scopes.
#
# Inserting "!" before the colon indicates that this commit introduces a breaking change.
# It is equivalent to a bump in MAJOR in SemVer standard.
# With this, the breaking change indicator in <footer> becomes optional.
#
# <description> contains a concise description of the change.
# The content should be in imperative mood, as if "This commit will..." is prepended.
# Do not capitalize the beginning of the sentence, and full stop (.) is omitted.
#
# <body> provides additional contextual information about the code changes and is optional.
# Multiple paragraphs separated by an empty line are allowed here.
# Sentences should be in imperative mood with proper capitalization and full stops (.).
#
# <footer> is a list of key-value pairs that store "metadata" of a commit.
# There are three types of a footer:
#   - Breaking change indicator     verbatim "BREAKING CHANGE:", followed by a <description>
#   - Automatic issue management    such as "Close #123", "Reference #123", "See #123", etc.
#   - Email-like metadata           such as "Signed-off-by:", "Co-authored-by", etc.
